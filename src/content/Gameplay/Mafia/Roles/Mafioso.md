## Description

Mafioso is the most basic of baddies. During the day, lie through your teeth and convince the Townies that you're their ally. At night, coordinate with your team to target a player to kill. 

If there is no *Godfather*, one of the mafioso will be picked at random to go and carry out the hit.

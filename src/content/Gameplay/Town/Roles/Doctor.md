## Description

The Doctor is a very powerful role that works best by staying undiscovered for as long as possible. Doctors are unable to heal themselves, but can be healed by other Doctors.

Note: By default, Doctors cannot heal the *Mayor*

As a doctor you need to work with the other [Town](#/content/Gameplay/Town/Town.md) members to lynch all those who would wish you harm.

Revive:
At night you may select another player to monitor. If that player is killed during the night you will revive them. 
This notifies the player that they were revived, and yourself that you successfully revived your target. It also notifies any other doctors that may have been protecting your target that night.
